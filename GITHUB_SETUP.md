```

## Step 3: Connect to GitHub

```bash
# Add the remote origin (replace with your actual repository URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git

# Verify the remote
git remote -v
```

## Step 4: Push to GitHub

```bash
# Push to main branch and set upstream
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 5: Set Up GitHub Actions (Optional)

The project includes GitHub Actions workflows for:
- **CI**: Testing and code quality checks
- **Deployment**: Automatic deployment to Render, Railway, and Vercel

### Required Secrets for Deployment

If you want to use the deployment workflows, add these secrets in your GitHub repository:

1. Go to your repository â†’ Settings â†’ Secrets and variables â†’ Actions
2. Add the following secrets:

#### For Render Backend Deployment
- `RENDER_TOKEN`: Your Render API token
- `RENDER_SERVICE_ID`: Your Render service ID

#### For Railway Backend Deployment
- `RAILWAY_TOKEN`: Your Railway API token

#### For Vercel Frontend Deployment
- `VERCEL_TOKEN`: Your Vercel API token
- `VERCEL_ORG_ID`: Your Vercel organization ID
- `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID`: Your Vercel project ID

## Step 6: Enable GitHub Features

### Issues
- Go to Settings â†’ Features
- Ensure "Issues" is enabled
- The project includes issue templates for bugs and feature requests

### Pull Requests
- Pull requests are enabled by default
- The project includes a PR template for better collaboration

### Actions
- GitHub Actions are enabled by default
- Workflows will run on push to main and pull requests

## Step 7: Project Settings

### Repository Description
Update your repository description to match the project:
```
A comprehensive platform for scraping, analyzing, and discovering Roblox games with real-time monitoring and trend detection. Built with FastAPI, React, and Supabase.
```

### Topics
Add relevant topics to your repository:
- `roblox`

- `react`
- `typescript`
- `postgresql`
- `web-scraping`
- `data-analysis`

### Social Preview
The project includes a comprehensive README.md that will serve as your repository's main page.

## Step 8: First Pull Request (Optional)

To test the workflow:
1. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b test-branch`
2. Make a small change
3. Commit and push: `git push origin test-branch`
4. Create a pull request on GitHub
5. Verify that CI checks pass

## Repository Structure

Your GitHub repository will now contain:

```
â”œâ”€â”€ .github/                    # GitHub Actions and templates
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ workflows/             # CI/CD workflows
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ISSUE_TEMPLATE/        # Issue templates
â”œâ”€â”€ backend/                    # FastAPI backend
â”œâ”€â”€ frontend/                   # React frontend
â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore                  # Git ignore rules
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md                   # Project documentation
â”œâ”€â”€ CONTRIBUTING.md             # Contribution guidelines
â”œâ”€â”€ CHANGELOG.md                # Version history
â”œâ”€â”€ LICENSE                     # MIT license
â”œâ”€â”€ DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md         # Deployment instructions
â””â”€â”€ setup_git.bat              # Git setup script
```

## Next Steps

1. **Share your repository** with your client for review
2. **Set up deployment** using the guides in `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`
3. **Invite collaborators** if needed
4. **Monitor issues and pull requests** for feedback

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Repository already exists"**
- The setup script will detect existing repositories
- Use `git status` to check current state

**"Permission denied"**
- Ensure you have write access to the repository
- Check your GitHub authentication

**"Branch not found"**
- Make sure you're on the main branch: `git checkout main`
- Create main branch if it doesn't exist: `git checkout -b main`

**Actions not running**
- Check that Actions are enabled in repository settings
- Verify workflow files are in `.github/workflows/`

1. Check the GitHub documentation
2. Review the project's README.md
